This repository includes an implementation of NEWS/D:

Modified Decomposition Framework and Algorithm for Many-objective Topology and Weight Evolution of Neural Networks
by: Salih, Adham and Moshaiov, Amiram
DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/cec45853.2021.9504953

In the current implementation, a regression-based optimization problem is provided.

The code uses modified functions from:
